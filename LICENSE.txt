QUINT LICENSE (CUSTOM)
"seriously, there's a custom license?"
Before reading, this license is just for protecting the files, to host a webpage.
Just follow the rules and you'll be fine.

RULES:
1.just don't copy any of my files
Seriously, just don't. It's for web-hosting.
(but if you want, go ahead.)
2.the webpage is simple
It's not like it's gonna work, so even if you're curious, I don't recommend finding the page.

That's it!
Yup, 2 rules, and a simple (does not work tho) page.
